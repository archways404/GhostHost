# GhostHost

GhostHost is a Rust-based application that makes hosting or sharing files online free, whilst being easy to use and very quick!

It works by breaking down your file(s) into base64 and then creates 5mb "chunks" that will be uploaded onto GhostBin and you will receive a "code" that you can use to rebuild the files!
